Database sqlite:
put tables in ./db/tables

run ./db/help to get a list of available scripts :

 CREATE    TABLES    ./db/scripts/create
   DROP    TABLES    ./db/scripts/drop
  RESET    TABLES    ./db/scripts/reset
   LIST    TABLES    ./db/scripts/list
-----------------------------------------
ENCRYPT   DATABASE   ./db/scripts/encrypt
WARNING: Will disable the other scripts from working.
(So do this once all the tables are created and good to go.)
